<h3>Principal component analysis for PIR</h3>


<strong>The Purpose of PIR</strong>:

PIR was intended to be utilized as technique that will build search-based algorithms for the purpose of obtaining hidden data from outside the parameters of search patterns that can be utilized in the methodical implementation of "premier" information retrieval and consequential "systems-neutralization". With <strong>Premier Information Retrieval</strong>®, the dynamics are constructed in the efforts of developing a variety of strategies that can be used in determining the "premier maneuver" for information retrieval via a neurogenetic basis that will perform information retrieval on the boundaries of six set points of data [with the largest points containing the most data] deemed the first to be "penetrated" by the search-based algorithms.

For those of you whom are familiar with wave propagation:

V(r) ∝ (σ / r)12 - (σ / r)6

Apparently, from the expression above, it's quite clear to see that, from a physics standpoint, energy is "data" and data is "energy". At least, that's how I associate the two variables. Normatively, the high determinant in the expression [i.e., V(r)] is relative to how it's positioned.

Position Space Wave Function:

PSWF = ψ(x) = k∫∞-∞ φ(P)exp(ipx/h) dp ψ(x)

Basically, a wave function, of any type, is a complex function or vector defined finitely or infinitely by an accompaniment of components. Above, you see a complex function comprised of elements [real variables such as infinite loops] tied to the wave-duality of particles, in which themselves possibly contain minute fragments of data conducive to the properties of Premier Information Retrieval®, a search-based algorithm, to retrieve. Wave functions, in this context, provide descriptions of the properties of the objects in which particular algorithms "recognize" through carefully constructed inferences or search patterns. Just like certain algorithms, wave functions exponentially evolve over time so, it would be advantageous of Premier Information Retrieval® to "train" these complex vectors, or functions, so that they'll learn to efficiently describe the information that's retrieved from a variety of particles (pockets of energy, i.e., penetrable molecules of data) within and beyond the environments from which they are confined. The principle, however, pertains to both position and momentum of a particle or particles, i.e., those six set points [read: data from the elements described by the wave function].

Momentum Space Wave Function:

MSWF = φ(p)= k∫∞-∞ ψ(x)exp(ipx/h) dx φ(p)

Where k=(1/(2πh)1/2)

In the expression up above, the wave function maps the possible states of a system's momentum into complex numbers, leaving the components, or values of the expression, to change the basis of the wave function but not alter the wave function itself and therefore, the momentum remains known to the algorithm [<strong>Premier Information Retrieval</strong>®, so to speak] but the position is now unknown (however, just because something's "unknown" doesn't mean that it's unknowable).

For any supposed algorithm that's implemented, is it capable of "penetrating" through the individual position environments of the numerous set points [PIR] and extracting the data that's needed when either the momentum (potentiality) or the position of such supposed elements are unknown to the algorithm? Will it determine which of the set points contains the most data [the largest of the set points]? How will the algorithm go about collecting six set points that'll contain the data it's purported to retrieve?


<strong>Description and Objective</strong>:

This repository is the principal component analysis code for the <strong>PIR</strong> (Premier Information Retrieval®)
research project and it's in addition to the GeneticAlgorithm-THL repository as well as other repositories that
will comprise the overall <strong>PIR</strong> project at hand.

For <strong>PIR</strong>, the objective of analysis is to transform the data into its principal components; the 
principal components are the eigenvectors of the covariance matrix that describe the relations among the
initial set of variables. With each eigenvector representing one new variable, the new variables become <i>orthogonal</i>,
or independent of one another. Eigenvalues, on the other hand, of the principal components correspond to the variance
(or, in this case, covariance) of each component. 

For the <strong>PIR</strong> project, I'm not just concerned with the direction of one vector because with an
eigenvector, you're not worried about <i>one</i> vector, you're dealing with <i>several</i> vectors. If there's a
complicated matrix to deal with then you want to make changes to the coordinates in order to make it simple. Think
of a diagonal matrix because you cannot always change the coordinates to revise the information in a matrix,
matrix N. Eigenvectors of a diagonal matrix are easier to find since the eigenvalues of those eigenvectors in a
diagonal matrix are just numbers on the diagonal. However, for <strong>PIR</strong>, you're dealing with more complex
matrices, therefore, in the matter of being advantageous, principal components will take a set of random vectors and
"orthogonalize" the set of vectors and "rotate" the vectors the same way you would rotate a vector by multiplying it
with a valid rotation matrix, say matrix N has a determinant of 1.

Don't take a matrix with a determinant of 1 and think that it's derived from a lower dimension. Principal components are
sorted via variance (or, covariance) in an order that decrements, so the first set of vectors will have larger
contributions in variance of the data with the last set of vectors having the smallest contribution. This seems similar
to <strong>PIR</strong> with the larger six <i>set</i> points of data being "penetrated" and the data within 
those <i>set</i> points being retrieved first, if that makes sense.
